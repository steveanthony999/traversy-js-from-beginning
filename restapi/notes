What is Rest

Representational State Transfer

architectural style for designing networked applications

relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocal, amost always http

made to treat objects on server side as resources that can be created updated and destroyed and read

example of server side object would be blog post, user, usually stored in database

create resources with post request

delete with delete request, so on

api is messenger, rest lets us use http rewquest to format that message

rest api takes in multiple types of requests

http requests

GET: retrieve data from a specified resources

POST: submit data to be processed to a specified resources

PUT: update a specified resources

DELETE: delete a specified resources

POST PUT and DELETE you're gonna send data along with your request, needs to know post data to add, which post to update, as well as the data you wanna update it with
